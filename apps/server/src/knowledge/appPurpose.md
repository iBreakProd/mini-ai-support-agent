# App Purpose — Arctic AI Support Showcase

This application (Arctic) is built to showcase an AI support bot. The primary purpose is to exhibit and demonstrate the AI's capabilities in a hydration e-commerce context.

What this app does:
- Provides an AI-powered support chatbot that assists users with products, orders, company policies, shipping, returns, and personalized hydration advice.
- Demonstrates how the AI can answer questions about the Arctic water brand, its products, orders, and policies.
- Allows users to create products, place orders, manage their hydration profile, and chat with the AI—all to support the showcase of the AI bot's abilities.
- The AI can use tools to fetch real data (products, orders, user profiles) and knowledge files (company info, shipping, returns) to give accurate, grounded answers.

When users ask "What is this app?", "What does Arctic do?", "What is the AI's purpose?", or "What does this application do?", the answer should reflect that this is a showcase/demo app built to demonstrate the AI support bot's capabilities in a hydration and e-commerce setting.
